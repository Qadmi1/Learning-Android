 
  When do developers write a sample app to test a new technology?
	They often write sample app to test a new technology to test it before building to their own larger app.

  What should we do if the line of code exceeds 100 columns?
	We should wrap the text to the next line then indent by 8 spaces.

  What is the difference between Synchronous callbacks and a Asynchrous callbacks
	Synchrous:Each line of code gets executed one after another and you must waitfor eachline to finish executing before
	going to the next line.
	Asynchrous:Jumb this particular block of code and continue executing the rest of the code and jumb back to this block
	of code when a certain even happens(Ex:onClicklisteners) even if that happend before executing the rest of the code.

  
  Why shoud we release media resources?
	Because if we don't it will cause our furure MediaPlayer object instances to not perform as effiecntly or drain the battery.

  How can we determine when we no longer need MediaPlayer resources?
	Generally if the MediaPlayer object is no longer being used and it depends on the app and you an check the MediaPlayer 
	life cycle to determine when you should release it in youre app (generally on the onStop method).

  How can we release the MediaPlayer resources and where is it recommened to do so in the code?
	We can do so using the MediaPlayer.release() method and you can put it in a "helper" method with additional optional code
	like the one we used with udacity and it is recommended to call it inside the onCompletionListener and before we instantiate
	a new MediaPlayer object.

  How can we make sure to release the MediaPlayer resources incase our user suddenly opened a different app?
	we can do so by releasing the resurces on the onStop() or onPause() methods.

  What is Audio Focus?
	Audio focus refers to the assumption that only one thing should be playing at a time.

  What does the AudioManager class in android allows us to do?
	1-Request Audio Focus.
	2-Abandon Audio Focus.
	3-Register a Listener to get notified of Audio Focus states changes.
	and other things we didn't learn yet.

  How can we know or remeber the code for the AudioManager class?
	I saved the most important code snippets in my favourite in chrome and it probably will always be enough to use on any app.

  What does API means in Android?
	API refers to the classes and methods that are offered by the Android framework that you as a developer can use.

  What does the requestAudioFocus (AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener l, 
                int streamType, 
                int durationHint) method do?
	 Send a request to obtain the audio focus.	
  
  What does the AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener listener do?
	Called on the listener to notify it the audio focus for this listener has been changed.

  What is the difference between the AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener and the durationHint parameter?
	durationHint indicates the time for the AudioFucos if granted and the it's important.
	the listener notify the requestAudioFocus method about the changes on the Audio Focus and allow the developer
	on deciding what to do in each case(check broser bookmarks for the cases).

  Talk more about previous question.
	The importance of the durationHint for example we choose AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_EXCLUSIVE that means the listener
	will not temporarily lose focus for system sounds like notifications however in other duration hints it will lose focus
	for system sounds.And you csn check more on the comments in the miwok app or the book marks. 

  How can you manage Audio Focus in the app?
	Check the miwok app or the github for udacity.

  Why add touch feedback for clickable views?
	They can make your app appear fast and responsive, even if nothing else happens yet.	

  How can we add the touch feed back to our views?
	1-use the "?android:attr/selectableItemBackground” attribute.
	2-use the android:drawSelectorOnTop="true" attribute for ListView.

  Note:The MediaPlayer class (Which handles media play backs like audio and video) has a state machine(meaning 
	at what state the current media is at e.g. idle, paused, started ... and you can find the state diagram
	at the official android developer website, and the state is not a life cycle for the MediaPlayer.
	The state changes inside any cycle of the Acticity life cycle, it changes inside it.
