What is the purpose of an Interface?
  It's sole porpuse is to be implemented by a class, it only lists what needs to be done but not how to do it.

Why Interfaces were introduced in Java?
  To solve the multiple inheritance problem which Java doesn't support.  

What is the use of an Interface in java?
  Unlike classes, Interfaces aren't  reducing the code we write, but they enforce a good design, meaning that we are forced to implement
  a number of methods.

What is the use of making a method "final"?
  When you make a method final, you protect it from being overridden, meaning that you can't override a final  method.

What is the use of making a field(instance variable) "final"?
  Simply it makes it constant, the value of the field cannot be changed.

What is the use of making an instance variable "static"?
  If you make an instance variable static the assigned value to that instance will be saved in it's class not the object itself, meaning: 1-you can access this instance from another class directly without creating an object. 2-If you call it again in another class or the same class it will still have it's assigned value rather than starting from the start.
