  1-What is the usage of the AndroidManifiest.XML file?
      It is like the table of contents in a book that summarize what's contained inside the book,
      similarly the manifest file summarizes the important information about the whole app in a single place.

  5-What are Input Events and EventListeners?
      Input Events: The android framework will call the callback methods when  For instance a View (such as a Button) is touched, 
      However, in order to intercept this, you must extend the class and override the method which is not practical if you have multiple views.
      This is why we use  Event Listeners which are interfaces with a single callback method like onClick for example.

  6-When would you use onClistener on a seperate class or inline?
    Seperate Class:If im gonna use the listener many times.
    Inline:If im gonna use it once and this is the most common.
  
  7-OnClickListener vs onClick?
      1-if you attach a button to a Listener you can change the behavior of your button while your app is running.
      2-onClick only recognize it's host Activity so you can only use Fragments with Listeners.
