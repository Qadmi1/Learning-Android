  What are new things you learned from reading the Soonami App?
	1-Async Task class:AsyncTask facilitates the usage of background threads in Android(without Async this will be complex).
	2-URL class:can be used to manipulate URLs of any protocol.
	3-HttpURLConnection:A URLConnection with support for HTTP-specific features.
	4-InputStream:This abstract class is the superclass of all classes representing an input stream of bytes.
	5-InputStreamReader:An InputStreamReader is a bridge from byte streams to character streams: It reads bytes and decodes 
	them into characters
	6-BufferedReader:Reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient 
	reading of characters, arrays, and lines.

  What are the steps for the Soonami App(Which takes data from an API)?
	1-Create an AsynTask class with our own custom type(custom class).
	2-Translate the USGS response into a URL(URL class type).
	3-Create an instance of HttpURLConnection and attach the url, method, readtime, connection time, and start the connection.
	4-Throw the instance of HttpURLConnection into an InputStream instance.
	5-Translate the InputStream to InputStreamReader then into a BufferReader.
	6-Assign The BufferReader(The data here is in JSON format because that's what the server uses) to a String.
	7-As long as the line is still alive meaning Data still being transmitted from the server append all that data to
	a StringBuilder.
	8-Return the String Builder As String and that String is in a JSON format(because the server uses JSON format).
